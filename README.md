# TrackView-III
A video Editor in the begenning

A Simple Video Player as a base for a Video Editor

Based on TrackView org which is based on WFPlayer

Special thanks to https://github.com/zhw2590582/WFPlayer for the Very nice design

This version is superior

It has a Spectrum analyser

You can zoom in/out by pressing the shift key with the mouse wheel. 

It let your hear sample of sound as you move the cursor like in Premiere Pro.
Every editor I tried don't have that feature;

N.B. Apparently, I have to give you the technology. No one else has come with such an easy feature. 
Yeah, I'm talking to you WonderShare for example. I've been asking you for that feature for more than 10 years.
